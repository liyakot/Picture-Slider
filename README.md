### Description
___
The mini-project is a picture switcher. Only 5 pictures, the active picture is full size.

It can be a useful addition to any site, for example, to display a assortment of products :sparkles:

The project is created with native JS and CSS, without any frameworks and libraries.

### How it works
___

When you click on a picture, it increases to 100% of its size, and all others decrease. This is implemented using the `flex` property:
  * `flex: 8` for active picture;
  * `flex: 1` for others

An example of the active picture compared to others:

<img width="400px" src="/readme_img/active-img.png">


As for adaptability - if the screen is less than *600px* - the pictures are arranged vertically
